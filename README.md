# bookstore
a bookshop (library-bookstore) in visual studio with SQLmetal and angular frontend


The bookstore saves the librarian's time by having a drag n drop feature for quick borrowing and unborrowing books

the workflow is designed so the librarian finds a customer quickly using the filter supplied by datatable
after finding, for.ex. Mitzy, he can click on the button which says "Mitzy's Basket" (all customers have this button in the datatable)
and then by using the Drag'n'drop (r) feature he can quickly borrow and unborrow books from the library
